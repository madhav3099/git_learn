all night it sighs,
it dies in memories all the time..
my heart doesn't listen to me..
There is some consciousness, some intoxication too..
some drowsiness and unconsciousness too..
my heart doesn't know a thing..


It was mine some time, but belongs to someone else now,
The mad heart doesn't understand..
sometimes it remains quiet,
sometimes it sings..
it tells good things about you without even asking..
whether you're some truth or a story (it doesn't know)
all it knows is that it's mad for you..
this heart of mine,
doesn't listen to me..
